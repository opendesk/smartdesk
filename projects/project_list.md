There are many possible uses for embedded tech in furniture. We have listed our current projects by broad category:

**Notifications**

Probably the most "must have" thing fit in an office desk.


**Data storage** - Buro Desk. Need to do some tests with various sync softwares and hardware.
**Health and ergonomics** - Numerous applications to do with workplace wellbeing - IoT meets the quantified self in the workplace; buzzwords to whet the appetite of VCs.
**Charging/NFC** - Simple and doable. Also enables other applications.
**Proximity** - passive response - various sensors that observe people near the desk.
**Interaction** - active control - sensors providing human interface controls to the desk such as vibration, sound, Hall effect etc.
**Rich Data Display/Printing** - We have a version of this already. What more should we do?
