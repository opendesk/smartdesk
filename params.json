This work to date has involved many outside Opendesk and we want to continue designing smartdesk with our partners and collaborators, makers and technologists, and anyone interested in putting together tech and plywood. \r\n\r\nWe have identified four principal areas of our work that are generic and span many possible projects and desirable applications of a smart desk.\r\n\r\nIn each area we are developing specs. We are thinking about what would be most useful to provide or specify to facilitate a wide range of collaborators and diverse projects: tight enough to be useful and loose enough to be accommodating.\r\n\r\n- **Hardware Interface**  - Physical integration of computing hardware into furniture.\r\n- **Component Interface** - Customisation of furniture to accommodate accessories.\r\n- **Furniture Identity** - Identity of furniture to facilitate integration of technology.\r\n- **Project Curation** - Curation of projects, software and documentation.\r\n\r\nThis repo serves as a home for the specs Opendesk are developing in each area and a point for discussion and collaboration on their development. Each has a markdown document containing the spec and an issue as a starting point for discussion. Any additional resources, designs, code binaries etc can go in the `resources/*` folders.\r\n\r\n**Projects**\r\n\r\nThis repo will also hold some individual project resources which can be added to the `projects` folder rather than their own repos.\r\n\r\n## Hardware Interface\r\n\r\nPhysical integration of computing hardware into furniture.\r\n\r\n[hardware interface spec](https://github.com/opendesk/smartdesk/blob/master/specs/hardware_interface_spec.md)\r\n\r\n[hardware interface issue](https://github.com/opendesk/smartdesk/issues/1)\r\n\r\n## Component Interface\r\n\r\nCustomisation of furniture to accommodate accessories.\r\n\r\n[component interface spec](https://github.com/opendesk/smartdesk/blob/master/specs/component_interface_spec.md)\r\n\r\n[component interface issue](https://github.com/opendesk/smartdesk/issues/2)\r\n\r\n## Furniture Identity\r\n\r\nIdentity of furniture to facilitate integration of technology.\r\n\r\n[furniture identity spec](https://github.com/opendesk/smartdesk/blob/master/specs/furniture_identity_spec.md)\r\n\r\n[furniture identity issue](https://github.com/opendesk/smartdesk/issues/3)\r\n\r\n## Project Curation\r\n\r\nCuration of projects, software and documentation.\r\n\r\n[project curation spec](https://github.com/opendesk/smartdesk/blob/master/specs/project_curation_spec.md)\r\n\r\n[project curation issue](https://github.com/opendesk/smartdesk/issues/4)\r\n\r\n## Projects\r\n\r\n[Some current projects](https://github.com/opendesk/smartdesk/blob/master/projects/project_list.md)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
